# Top-level makefile for building everything LCD-related.
#
# A lot of this script has been split up into parts so it's in
# smaller bite size pieces.
#
# TARGETS (all phony):
#
#    all                 --  Build microkernel, liblcd, and all
#                            test modules/examples
#
#    libcap.X,           --  Build libcap/libfipc/libasync for X, where X is
#    libfipc.X,                   microkernel
#    libasync.X                   liblcd
#                                 libdeker
#
#                            libasync.X depends on libfipc.X being built.
#
#    microkernel         --  Build the LCD microkernel and kLIBLCD; depends
#                            on libcap/libfipc/libasync microkernel builds.
#
#    liblcd              --  Build liblcd library kernel; depends on
#                            on libcap/libfipc/libasync liblcd builds.
#
#    libdeker            --  Build libdeker; depends on
#                            on libcap/libfipc/libasync libdeker builds.
#
#    test_mods           --  Builds all of the test modules/examples. If
#                            DEKER is set, isolated test modules require
#                            libdeker; otherwise, they require liblcd.
#
#    clean               --  Remove built object files and local
#                            install directories. But doesn't delete
#                            config'd build directories.
#
#    distclean           --  Deletes all object files and build directories.
#                            Does NOT delete files created by autoconf. You
#                            need to manually delete those. (These are not
#                            under version control though, FYI.)
